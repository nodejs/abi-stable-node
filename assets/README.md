# About these files

In February 2021, the N-API project was renamed to Node-API.

In order to maintain links that module maintainers may have created to
these files, the badge files using the old file naming convention have been
retained. Moving forward, the “Node-API“ naming convention should be used
for new badge image files.

[Renaming n-api to something more appropriate and
descriptive](https://github.com/nodejs/abi-stable-node/issues/420)
