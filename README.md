# Node.js API (Node-API)
This repository is the home for ABI Stable Node API project Node-API which was previously known as N-API.

The goal of this project is to provide a stable Node API for native
module developers. Node-API aims to provide ABI compatibility guarantees
across different Node versions and also across different Node
VMs - allowing Node-API enabled native modules to just work
across different versions and flavors of Node.js without recompilations.

It is introduced by this Node enhancement proposal:
[005-ABI-Stable-Module-API.md](https://github.com/nodejs/node-eps/blob/master/005-ABI-Stable-Module-API.md).

Node-API is part of [Node.js core](http://github.com/nodejs/node). Documentation is available here:
[https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/n-api.html](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/n-api.html).

Node.js versions 8.12.0 and above provide Node-API as a stable feature.

## Branches

Currently this repo is being used only for meta issue management and
future planning by the [Node-API team](https://github.com/orgs/nodejs/teams/node-api). 

## API Design & Shape

The current shape of the API can be found in header file
[node_api.h](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/master/src/node_api.h).
Full documentation is available as part of the standard Node.js API docs here:
[https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/n-api.html](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/n-api.html).

There is also a header-only [C++ API](https://github.com/nodejs/node-addon-api), which
simplifies development while still using the same ABI-stable Node API underneath.
It is distributed as a separate npm package: [https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-addon-api](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-addon-api).

## Testing

In addition to running the tests in the converted modules we also have a converted version of the NAN examples
  [node-addon-examples](https://github.com/nodejs/node-addon-examples)

## How to get involved
* Convert a native module to use [Node-API](https://github.com/nodejs/abi-stable-node/blob/api-prototype-8.x/src/node_api.h) and report issues on conversion and performance;
* Port ABI stable APIs to your fork of Node and let us know if there are gaps;
* Review the [roadmap](https://github.com/nodejs/abi-stable-node/milestones) and see how you
can help accelerate this project.

## Badges

The use of badges is recommended to indicate the minimum version of Node-API
required for the module. This helps to determine which Node.js major versions
are supported. Addon maintainers can consult the [Node-API support matrix][] to
determine which Node.js versions provide a given Node-API version. The following
badges are available:

## Meeting

The team meets once a week on zoom. See the **[Node.js Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=nodejs.org_nr77ama8p7d7f9ajrpnu506c98%40group.calendar.google.com)** for the current time/day of the week.
