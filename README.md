# Node.js API (N-API)
This repository is the home for ABI Stable Node API project (N-API).
The goal of this project is to provide a stable Node API for native
module developers. N-API aims to provide ABI compatibility guarantees
across different Node versions and also across different Node
VMs - allowing N-API enabled native modules to just work
across different versions and flavors of Node.js without recompilations.

It is introduced by this Node enhancement proposal:
[005-ABI-Stable-Module-API.md](https://github.com/nodejs/node-eps/blob/master/005-ABI-Stable-Module-API.md).

N-API is now part of core. Documentation is available here:
[https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/n-api.html](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/n-api.html).

As of Node.js version 8.6.0 N-API is enabled by default. If you use an N-API enabled module you
will be warned that it is experimental as follows:

```
(node:16761) Warning: N-API is an experimental feature and could change at any time.
```

Node.js versions 8.12.0 and above provide N-API as a stable feature.

**Branches**

Currently this repo is being used only for meta issue management and
future planning by the [N-API team](https://github.com/orgs/nodejs/teams/n-api). All branches can be considered `stale` as they are no longer
being maintained. Updates and changes to N-API are being done
in the core [repo](http://github.com/nodejs/node).

**API Design & Shape**

The current shape of the API can be found in header file
[node_api.h](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/master/src/node_api.h).
Full documentation is available as part of the standard Node.js API docs here:
[https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/n-api.html](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/n-api.html).

There is also a header-only [C++ API](https://github.com/nodejs/node-addon-api), which
simplifies development while still using the same ABI-stable Node API underneath.
It is distributed as a separate npm package: [https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-addon-api](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-addon-api).

**Testing**

In addition to running the tests in the converted modules we also have

* a converted version of the NAN examples
  [node-addon-examples](https://github.com/nodejs/node-addon-examples)

* a converted version of the [core addons tests](https://github.com/nodejs/node/tree/master/test/addons-napi) which can be run with `make test addons-napi`

**How to get involved**
* Convert a native module to use [N-API](https://github.com/nodejs/abi-stable-node/blob/api-prototype-8.x/src/node_api.h) and report issues on conversion and performance;
* Port ABI stable APIs to your fork of Node and let us know if there are gaps;
* Review the [roadmap](https://github.com/nodejs/abi-stable-node/milestones) and see how you
can help accelerate this project.
